# LineBridge

**Turns the CSV logs that assembly machines already write into the exact files a factory's MES expects, then delivers, archives and audits them, with no changes to the machine.**

> Every CNC / SMT machine on an electronics assembly line logs each action to CSV.
> Every factory's MES (Manufacturing Execution System) wants that data in its own format, over its own channel.
> LineBridge sits in the middle on the machine PC, needs nothing but Python, and closes that gap in minutes instead of a custom integration project.

## 1. The problem

In electronics assembly (pick-and-place, screen printers, reflow ovens, AOI, CNC routers), each machine writes a **record of every action** (part placed, nozzle used, position, result, errors) into a CSV file in a local folder. A new file arrives after every board or batch, continuously.

Integrated factories run a **third-party MES** to track production, traceability and quality. The trouble:

| Reality on the shop floor | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Every MES make uses **different protocols** to talk to machines | A connector must be built per MES × per machine model |
| The MES usually wants **a different format** than the machine's CSV (JSON, a flat CSV, fixed TXT) | Someone has to transform the files |
| One machine CSV contains **many tables** (header, placements, feeders, nozzles, errors), but the MES needs only some | Data must be picked out precisely, e.g. *L1 × M8* |
| Context the machine doesn't know (**operator, shift, work order**) must travel with the data | It has to be typed in and merged |
| Delivery differs per customer: **a shared network folder** for some, **a web API link** for others | Two delivery paths, and either can be down |
| New files keep arriving | Processed files must be **moved to a back-up folder** so only fresh files are picked up, and nothing is lost |

Today this is solved with manual copying, one-off scripts that break silently, or expensive vendor integration projects.

## 2. Why it matters

- **Traceability is mandatory** in automotive, medical and aerospace electronics. If a board fails in the field, the factory must prove which part, feeder and nozzle placed each component. Missing or late machine data means failed audits and wider recalls.
- **Legacy machines are the majority.** Modern standards like IPC-CFX need the machine vendor to support them. Older machines, which keep running for many years, only write files.
- **Manual handling is slow and error-prone.** Copying files by hand loses data on night shifts, duplicates data when a file is copied twice, and gives no proof of what was sent.
- **Every new customer or MES means rework.** Contract manufacturers serve many customers, each with its own MES and format.

LineBridge makes the existing CSV the integration point. If the machine can write a file, it can feed any MES.

## 3. What LineBridge does

```
 Machine writes CSV ─► LineBridge (on the machine PC) ─► MES-ready JSON / CSV / TXT
                         │  pick tables (up to 10)          ├─► shared folder (\\MES\inbox)
                         │  add 2 manual inputs             └─► customer API link (HTTPS)
                         │  archive original to back-up
                         └─ record everything in an audit ledger
```

| Your requirement | LineBridge feature |
|---|---|
| 1. CSV files arrive in a folder one by one | Folder watcher, oldest first, waits until the machine has finished writing |
| 2. Pull the files from the folder | Automatic pickup, or **Run once** on demand |
| 3. Extract particular tables into JSON, CSV or TXT | Table detection + 3 output formats (CSV in *sections* or *flat* layout) |
| 4. User picks the table, e.g. L1 x M8 | Pick by **table name** (`L1xM8`), **Excel-style cell range** (`L1:M8`), with optional **column filter** |
| 5. Up to 10 selections + 2 manual inputs in the same file | 10 selection boxes + 2 name/value inputs written into every output |
| 6. Save to a shared folder **and/or** send by API, with a separate link field | Two independent destinations, each with on/off, its own settings and a **Test** button |
| 7. Move used files to a separate back-up folder | Originals moved into `backup/YYYY-MM-DD/`; failures to `backup/_failed/`, re-sent copies to `backup/_duplicates/` |

## 4. Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.9 or newer. No packages to install, no internet needed.

```bash
# Live demo: machine simulator + mock customer MES + LineBridge, all on this PC
python demo/run_demo.py --reset
```
Two browser tabs open:
- **LineBridge control panel**: http://localhost:8600
- **Customer MES inbox (mock)**: http://localhost:8080

A new board log appears every few seconds and you can watch it get converted and delivered. Click **Simulate outage** on the MES page and the files queue up. Restore it and they are re-sent automatically. Every 6th file is a re-sent copy, which the duplicate guard blocks.

Windows users can double-click **`start_demo.bat`** instead.

**Use with a real machine:**
```bash
python -m linebridge ui --config config.json      # opens the control panel on http://localhost:8600
```
Set the folders, pick tables, choose a format and delivery, click **Save**, then **Start watching**.

## 5. How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M[Machine PC folder<br/>*.csv] -->|stable for 2 s| D[Detect]
    D --> F[Fingerprint<br/>SHA-256]
    F -->|seen before| DUP[backup/_duplicates]
    F --> P[Parse into tables<br/>+ cell ranges]
    P --> S[Apply up to 10<br/>selectors]
    S --> MI[Add 2 manual inputs<br/>+ metadata]
    MI --> R[Render JSON / CSV / TXT<br/>atomic write]
    R --> SH[Shared folder]
    R --> API[Customer API]
    SH -. down .-> Q[(Outbox<br/>auto-retry)]
    API -. down .-> Q
    R --> B[Move source to<br/>backup/YYYY-MM-DD]
    B --> L[(Audit ledger<br/>SQLite)]
    P -. unreadable .-> FAIL[backup/_failed]
```

Step by step, for every file:

1. **Detect.** The watcher polls the machine folder (default every 3 s). A file is only touched once it has been unchanged for `stable_seconds`, so half-written files are never read.
2. **Fingerprint.** A SHA-256 hash is computed. If the same content was already delivered, the file is moved to `backup/_duplicates` and not sent again.
3. **Parse.** The CSV is split into tables. A table is an optional title row (`[L1xM8]`, `Table: L1xM8`) followed by a header row and data rows, ending at a blank row. Trailing padding columns are removed. Each table remembers its spreadsheet range (e.g. `A12:I24`). Comma, semicolon and tab delimiters are auto-detected.
4. **Select.** Up to 10 selectors pick tables, cell ranges and columns (see §6).
5. **Enrich.** The 2 manual inputs, station name, source file name, processing time and SHA-256 are added.
6. **Render.** The output is written as JSON, CSV or TXT using an **atomic write** (temp file then rename), so an MES polling the folder never sees a partial file.
7. **Deliver.** The file is copied to the shared folder and/or POSTed to the API link. If a destination fails, the file goes into an **outbox** and is retried at the start of every cycle, in order.
8. **Archive.** The original CSV moves to `backup/<date>/`, leaving the machine folder clean for the next file.
9. **Record.** One row goes into the SQLite audit ledger: time, file, hash, tables, output name, and the status of each destination.

## 6. Selecting data

Each of the 10 selection boxes accepts:

| You type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `L1xM8` | The table titled L1xM8. Case, spaces and `×` don't matter: `l1 x m8`, `L1×M8`, `[L1xM8]` all work |
| `L2x*` | Every table matching the wildcard |
| `L1:M8` or `L1 x M8` | If **no table** has that name, it is read as an **Excel-style cell range** (columns L–M, rows 1–8). First row = column headers |
| `A12:I*` | Range down to the **last row**, useful when row counts vary per board |
| `L1xM8[Ref, Result]` | Only these columns, in this order (works for ranges too) |
| *(all empty)* | Every table in the file |

> Why both? "L1 x M8" is read on the floor both as *Line 1 × Machine 8* (a section in the log) and as a *cell block* in a spreadsheet. LineBridge supports both, and a named table always takes priority.

The **Preview & test** tab shows every table found in a real file with its cell range. One click adds a table to a selection box, and you see the exact output before going live.

![Preview](docs/screenshots/02_preview.png)

## 7. Output formats

Every output carries the same metadata: source file, processed time, station, SHA-256 of the source, generator version, and the manual inputs.

**JSON** (default)
```json
{
  "source_file": "L1M8_board_00017.csv",
  "processed_at": "2026-10-09T19:55:45",
  "station": "SMT Line 1 · Machine 8",
  "sha256": "58331a41d30f911c37da2cd678d9771780b9b68fd42870ea97451d6d9fe638ae",
  "generator": "LineBridge 1.0.0",
  "manual_inputs": { "Operator": "OP-17", "Work order": "WO-1187" },
  "tables": {
    "L1xM8": {
      "range": "A12:I24",
      "columns": ["Timestamp", "Ref", "Part_No", "Result"],
      "row_count": 12,
      "rows": [ { "Timestamp": "2026-10-09 10:00:00.581", "Ref": "R101", "Part_No": "RC0402-10K", "Result": "OK" } ]
    }
  }
}
```

**CSV, sections layout:** metadata lines starting with `#`, then one `[table]` block per selection.
**CSV, flat layout:** a single table, one row per record, with `source_file, processed_at, table, <manual inputs>, <all columns>`. This is the easiest layout for a database or MES import wizard.
**TXT:** an aligned, human-readable report for printing or for MES systems that read fixed-width text.

## 8. Delivery

| Destination | Details |
|---|---|
| **Shared folder** | Local path or UNC path (`\\MES-SERVER\inbox`). Written atomically. **Test folder** checks it is writable |
| **API link** | `POST` to the URL entered in the panel. Body is either the **raw file** (`Content-Type` matches the format) or a **multipart form** upload (`file` + `station`). Headers: `X-Filename`, `X-Station`, `X-Content-SHA256`, and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` if a token is set. **Test connection** sends a small test payload |

Both can be on at the same time. Each one is retried independently.

## 9. Reliability features

| Risk on the floor | How LineBridge handles it |
|---|---|
| Machine still writing the file | File must be unchanged for `stable_seconds` before pickup |
| MES or network down | Output kept in `output/_outbox/<destination>`, retried every cycle in original order, ledger updated to `ok (retried)` |
| Same log re-sent by the machine or copied twice | SHA-256 duplicate guard; nothing is sent twice |
| Corrupt file or unexpected layout | Moved to `backup/_failed`, error in the ledger and live log; the watcher keeps running |
| MES reads a half-copied file | Atomic writes everywhere (temp name + rename) |
| "Did we send board B240017 to the customer?" | Audit ledger with hash, time and per-destination status, visible in the **History** tab |
| PC reboot | Settings in `config.json`, ledger on disk, outbox on disk; restart and it continues |

![History](docs/screenshots/03_history.png)

## 10. What makes it different

1. **Zero-touch on the machine.** No firmware, PLC or vendor change. If the machine writes a CSV, LineBridge works.
2. **Zero-install on the PC.** Pure Python standard library. Runs on locked-down, offline factory PCs.
3. **Engineer-friendly selection.** Pick by table name *or* spreadsheet cell range, wildcards, column filters, all with a live preview on a real file.
4. **Store-and-forward delivery.** Network outages don't lose data; the queue drains automatically.
5. **Built-in traceability.** Every file is fingerprinted and logged, so the audit question has an answer.
6. **One tool, many MES.** Same engine; per-customer differences are just settings (format, layout, destination, auth).
7. **Demo-ready.** Ships with a machine simulator and a mock MES so anyone can see it working in 2 minutes.

## 11. Existing solutions

| Approach | What it is | Gap LineBridge fills |
|---|---|---|
| **IPC-CFX (IPC-2591)** | Open industry standard for machine-to-machine and machine-to-business messaging; uses AMQP transport with JSON messages | Requires the **machine vendor** to implement CFX. Installed legacy machines that only write log files are left out |
| **IPC-HERMES-9852** | Successor to SMEMA for board handover between machines on a line (TCP/IP + XML: board IDs, dimensions, conveyor data) | Covers line-internal board flow, **not** exporting process logs to an MES |
| **Full MES / factory connectivity suites** (e.g. Aegis FactoryLogix, Cogiscan, Arch Systems, Siemens Opcenter) | End-to-end platforms with their own machine connectors | Licensed suites with per-site integration projects. They don't help when the customer's MES is *a different make* that just wants files in its format |
| **Generic industrial connectivity** (e.g. Kepware, Node-RED) | Protocol servers and flow tools, strong for PLC tags and OPC UA | Built around tags and protocols, not multi-table CSV logs; each flow is hand-built and needs separate tooling for audit and duplicate protection |
| **Custom scripts / manual copying** | What many lines run today | No preview, no retry, no audit trail, breaks silently, depends on one person |

**Positioning:** LineBridge is not an MES and does not replace CFX. It is the **last-mile adapter for file-based machines**. It is cheap enough to put on every legacy machine PC and turns them into clean, auditable data sources for *whatever* MES the customer runs. A CFX publisher is on the roadmap, so the same files can also be emitted as standard CFX messages.

## 13. Configuration reference

All settings can be changed in the control panel. They are stored in `config.json`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `station_name` | `SMT Line 1` | Written into every output and API header |
| `input_folder` | `./input` | Folder the machine writes CSVs into |
| `file_pattern` | `*.csv` | Which files to pick up |
| `backup_folder` | `./backup` | Used source files (dated sub-folders), `_failed`, `_duplicates` |
| `output_folder` | `./output` | Generated files, plus `_outbox` for pending deliveries |
| `output_format` | `json` | `json`, `csv` or `txt` |
| `csv_layout` | `sections` | `sections` or `flat` (CSV only) |
| `selections` | 10 × `""` | Selectors (§6) |
| `manual_inputs` | 2 × `{label, value}` | Operator-entered fields |
| `shared_enabled` / `shared_folder` | off | Shared-folder delivery |
| `api_enabled` / `api_url` / `api_token` / `api_body` | off | API delivery (`raw` or `multipart`) |
| `skip_duplicates` | `true` | SHA-256 duplicate guard |
| `poll_seconds` | `3` | How often the folder is checked |
| `stable_seconds` | `2` | How long a file must be unchanged before pickup |
| `ledger_path` | `./linebridge_ledger.db` | Audit ledger location |

## 14. Deploying on a factory PC

- **Interactive:** `start_panel.bat` (or `python -m linebridge ui --start`) starts the panel and begins watching.
- **Unattended service:** `python -m linebridge run --config config.json`. Register it with Windows Task Scheduler ("At startup", "Run whether user is logged on or not"), or wrap it with NSSM as a Windows service.
- **Remote access to the panel:** `python -m linebridge ui --host 0.0.0.0`, but only on a trusted plant network, since the panel has no login in v1.
- **Single .exe (optional):** `pip install pyinstaller` then `pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "linebridge/static;linebridge/static" -n LineBridge linebridge/__main__.py`.
- **CLI helpers:** `python -m linebridge preview some_file.csv` lists tables and ranges and prints the output; `python -m linebridge history` shows the last 30 ledger entries.

## 15. Testing

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
The 19 tests cover table detection and ranges, padding removal, every selector form, all output formats and layouts, the full pipeline against a live mock MES, outage → queue → retry, the duplicate guard, failed-file quarantine, skipping files still being written, and multipart upload.

## 16. Roadmap

- **IPC-CFX publisher** (AMQP) as a third destination, so file-only machines appear as CFX endpoints
- **Machine profiles:** saved parser and selection presets per machine model, shareable between lines
- **Field mapping / renaming** to match MES column names exactly, plus unit conversion
- **Fleet view:** many LineBridge stations reporting to one dashboard
- **Panel login** and encrypted token storage
- **Excel (.xlsx) and XML** inputs and outputs
